TODO: features
- specify file extension behavior
	- If a file extension is supplied, search for references of all files of that file extension

- Specify single file
	- If a single file name is given, search for references of that file.

- Specify file extensions to look through. i.e only text files, or only cpp files.

- If no reference was found, include the path to the file name we were looking for in the log
- Nice formatting for references that were found.
